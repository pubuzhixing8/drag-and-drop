# light-drag-and-drop

A lightweight drag and drop library, currently still in beta stage.


## Inspiration
light-dnd is inspired by the drag scene of rich text editors (highly customized drag and drop interaction), and the DOM native drag and drop events cannot meet all functional requirements. This library uses mouse events to handle drag and drop behavior, mainly including drag event simulation and general drag and drop interaction processing.

## Features

- Auto scroll handling

- Esc cancel drag
  
- Custom mouse cursor
